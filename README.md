## Using Copilot

In this exercise I have used Copilot to explore a document and research some ideas for a cleaning business. Copilot can read a text file and develop ideas, adding information in a concise way:

Even the name for the business can be suggested by Copilot. The Logo and a photorealist office were also generated by Copilot:

Those images can be used in a power point apresentation and can be sent by email to an investor. Even the email message can be generated by Copilot.

So, it is clear that Copilot proves to be a very powerful tool to gather information and organize it in order to provide a coherent text.
